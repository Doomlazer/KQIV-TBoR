# Kingâ€™s Quest IV: The Breasts of Rosella

A mod for King's Quest IV that adds new puzzles, solutions, QoL changes, sequence breaks, dialogue changes and more.

This project started life as an ironic 'nude patch' for KQ4 and grew from there as I learned what was possible with <a href="http://scicompanion.com">SCI Companion</a>. Yes, a KQ4 nude patch is a stupid idea, but I painted myself into a corner and now I'm stuck with it. Hopefully, players can find something worthwhile below the surface.

Features: See <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/wiki">the wiki</a> for all changes/additions.

Content advisory: Adult situations, drug references, suicide and nudity.


## INSTALLATION

Easy way (PC only): 

<a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/releases/download/v1.0/KQ4-TBoR-Patcher.exe">Download the patch installer</a>.

Manual way:

Download the patch files <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/releases/download/v0.999/KQIV-TBoRv0.99999.zip">here</a>. Copy the PATCHES folder into your KQ4 game folder and start normally through ScummVM. Remove the PATCHES folder to uninstall.

This mod should only be used with ScummVM - It has heap crashes in DOSbox and you will get stuck halfway through the game!
