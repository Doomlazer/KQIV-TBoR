# Kingâ€™s Quest IV: The Breasts of Rosella

This mod started life as an ironic 'nude patch' for KQ4 and grew from there as I learned what was possilbe with <a href="http://scicompanion.com">SCI Companion</a>. I realize that a KQ nude patch is a stupid idea, but I painted myself into a corner and I'm stuck with it now. Hopefully there are some redeeming features below the surface. This mod is not intended to degrade women in any way and makes an effort to avoid misogyny. 

Features: See <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/wiki">the wiki</a> for all changes/additions.

Content advisory: Adult situations, drug-use, violence/suicide and nudity.

## INSTALLATION

Copy resouce.001, resource.004 and resource.map to your KQ4 game folder and run in ScummVM. Requires the retail version of KQ4 (Steam or GOG).

DOSBox warning: recently this mod started crashing with the "Out of heap space" message. It happens when entering the Dwarf or Ogre houses for apparently no reason. I've troubleshooted these issues before and have always been able to track down the problem, but I haven't found a way to reliably reproduce this crash. When it does happen, there should be pleanty of memory available. I've already spent at least a dozen hours working on this and at the moment it's not looking good. So far, this crash has not appeared at all in ScummVM. This mod sucks anyway and I fucking hate it, so if you do try it - use ScummVM I guess. Fuck this shit :(
