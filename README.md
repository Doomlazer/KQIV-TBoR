## About

This project started life as an ironic 'nude patch' for KQ4 and grew from there as I learned what was possible with <a href="http://scicompanion.com">SCI Companion</a>. Yes, a KQ4 nude patch is a stupid idea, but I painted myself into a corner and now I'm stuck with it. 

Keep in mind this is a parody. There is nothing titillating about EGA nudity. The mod is intended to be viewed as if it was developed in the 80s by a horny 13 year old boy (that somehow had tools to mod SCI games). It's intentionally crude, often poorly executed and sometimes offensive - that is the asthetic. The game does not reflect my personal additudes, or modern sensibilities. 

After recieving feedback on some questionable content in the original release version, I decided to dial back the more offensive sequences. Those desperate to experience the original version may download the <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/releases/download/v1.0/KQ4-TBoR-Patcher.exe">original release installer</a>.
