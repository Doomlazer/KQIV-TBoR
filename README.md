# Kingâ€™s Quest IV: The Breasts of Rosella

This mod started life as an ironic 'nude patch' for KQ4 and grew from there as I learned what was possilbe with <a href="http://scicompanion.com">SCI Companion</a>. I realize that a KQ4 nude patch is a stupid idea, but I painted myself into a corner and now I'm stuck with it. Hopefully there are some redeeming features below the surface. This mod is not intended to be demeaning towards women in any way. 

Features: See <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/wiki">the wiki</a> for all changes/additions.

Content advisory: Adult situations, drug use, violence and nudity.


## INSTALLATION

Copy resouce.001, resource.004 and resource.map to your KQ4 game folder and run in ScummVM. Requires the retail version of KQ4 (Steam or GOG).

DOSBox warning: recently this mod started crashing in DOSBox with the "Out of heap space" message. It happens sometimes when entering the Fisherman, Dwarf or Ogre houses for apparently no reason. I've delt with these heap issues before and have always been able to track down and fix the problem, but so far I haven't found a way to reliably reproduce the crash. It's inconsistant and when it does happen, there should be pleanty of memory available. 

I've already spent at least a dozen hours working on this crash with no progress and I'm losing hope it can be fixed. So far, this crash has not appeared at all in ScummVM, so use that I guess. This mod sucks anyway and I fucking hate it.
