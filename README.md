# Kingâ€™s Quest IV: The Breasts of Rosella

A mod for King's Quest IV that adds new puzzles, solutions, QoL changes, sequence breaks, dialogue changes and more.

This project started life as an ironic 'nude patch' for KQ4 and grew from there as I learned what was possible with <a href="http://scicompanion.com">SCI Companion</a>. Yes, a KQ4 nude patch is a stupid idea, but I painted myself into a corner and now I'm stuck with it. 

Keep in mind this is a parody. There is nothing titillating about EGA nudity. The mod is intended to be viewed as if it was developed by a horny 13 year old boy that had the tools to mod SCI games back in the 80s. It's intentionally crude, often poorly executed and sometimes offensive - that is the asthetic. The game does not reflect my personal additudes or modern sensibilities. 

Features: See <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/wiki">the wiki</a> for all changes/additions and walkthrough.

Content advisory: Adult situations, drug references, suicide and nudity.


## INSTALLATION

Easy way (PC only): 

Note: the installer is missing several bug fixes. Downloading and manually copying the patch folder is recommened.

<a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/KQIV-TBoR/releases/download/v1.0/KQ4-TBoR-Patcher.exe">Download the patch installer</a>.


Manual way:

Clone or download the repo. copy the PATCHES folder into your KQ4 game folder and start normally through ScummVM. Remove the PATCHES folder to uninstall.

This mod should only be used with ScummVM - It has heap crashes in DOSbox and you will get stuck halfway through the game!
