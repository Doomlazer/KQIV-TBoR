(class Timer kindof Object
	;;; The Timer class implements the concept of an alarm clock,
	;;; cue:ing another object after a certain interval.  Timers
	;;; dispose: of themselves after cue:ing their client, and always
	;;; check to see if their client is still present before cue:ing it.

	;;; An important concept relating to Timers is that of game time
	;;; versus real time.  Real time is just what it sounds like --
	;;; real time in real seconds.  Game time is time adjusted to the
	;;; performance of the user's computer -- it is the same as real
	;;; time on a computer which is able to keep up with the animation
	;;; demands of the game, but slows down in proportion to the speed
	;;; of the user's computer when it is not able to keep up.

	;;; An example may help clarify this.  Say that you're writing a
	;;; game in which ego has only five seconds to leave a room before
	;;; a bomb blows up.  If you set this time interval as real time,
	;;; it may give you just enough time to get out on your nice fast
	;;; 286 or 386 machine.  But on a Tandy 1000, where it takes 1/5th
	;;; of a second to complete an animation cycle instead of the
	;;; standard 1/10th of a second, the user will only be able to go
	;;; half as far and thus has no chance of leaving the room before
	;;; the bomb blows.  The time interval should really have been set
	;;; in game time, which would have given the user the same number
	;;; of animation cycles to get out.

	;;; As a rule of thumb, time intervals which are meant to be a
	;;; constraint on how long the user has to do something should be
	;;; set in game time, whereas time intervals which are just meant
	;;; to be a delay between two events should be real time.  A user
	;;; with a slow machine has no desire to watch a banner screen
	;;; twice as long as one with a fast machine.
