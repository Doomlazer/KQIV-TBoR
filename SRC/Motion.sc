;;;;	Classes for moving and cycling animated objects.
;;;;	Cycling classes change the cel number of their client in a consistent
;;;; 	manner in response to the doit: message.  This makes the object seem
;;;;	to animate.
;;;;	Motion classes change the x,y position of their client in response
;;;;	to the doit: message.  Each class implements a different way of
;;;;	moving an object.
;;;;
;;;;	Classes:
;;;;		Cycle
;;;;		Forward
;;;;		Walk
;;;;		Reverse
;;;;		CycleTo
;;;;		EndLoop

;;;; MOTION CLASSES ------------------------------------------------------------

;;;; All Actor motion attempts to get from point A to point B in a straight

;;;; with non-unit steps.  See "bresen.doc" for a derivation of the algorithm.
;;;; The bulk of Motion code (particularly the Bresenham algorithm) has been
