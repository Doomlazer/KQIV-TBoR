(class Sound kindof Object
	;;; The class which plays music.  Sounds which have been init:ed have
	;;; an internal kernel node allocated for them which stores information
	;;; which needs to be accessed quickly.  This information can only be
	;;; changed by the changeState: method or another init: of the Sound.

	;;; Sounds are prioritized, with the highest priority sound which has
	;;; been issued the play: message being the sound which is actually played.
	;;; All other sounds are in a blocked (SND_BLOCKED) state, and when the
	;;; current sound is finished, the highest priority  blocked sound is
	;;; restarted.

	;;; Sounds can have built-in 'cue's to help in synchronizing animation
	;;; with the music.

	;;; Sounds may be 'owned' by Rooms or Regions, and an 'owned' Sound is
	;;; dispose:d whenever its owner is dispose:d.  A Sound with no owner
	;;; is dispose:d whenever any Room or Region is dispose:d.

	(properties
		state SND_NOTREADY
				;SND_NOTREADY
				;	Sound has not been init:ed, or has finished playing.
				;SND_READY
				;	Sound has been init:ed, but has not been sent the play: message.
				;SND_BLOCKED
				;	Sound has been sent the play: message, but either a higher
				;	priority sound is playing or sounds are paused.
				;SND_ACTIVE
				;	This is the currently playing Sound.
		number 0			;the number of the sound
		priority 0		;priority of the sound (normal == 0)

		signal 0			;this is set (briefly) to the value of an animation cue
							;encountered by the sound
